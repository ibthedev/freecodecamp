                    <h2>Below is a timeline of Prophet Muhammad's life:</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>570 -</strong> Muhammad was born in the year 570 in the town of Mecca, a mountain
                                town
                                in the
                                high desert plateau of western Arabia. His name derives from the Arabic verb hamada,
                                meaning
                                "to praise, to glorify." He was the first and only son of Abd Allah bin Al-Muttalib and
                                Amina bint Wahb. Abd Allah died before Muhammad's birth and Muhammad was raised by his
                                mother Amina, who in keeping with Meccan tradition entrusted her son at an early age to
                                a
                                wet nurse named Halima from the nomadic tribe of the Sa'd ibn Bakr. He grew up in the
                                hill
                                country, learning their pure Arabic.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <p><strong>575 - </strong>When Muhammad was five or six his mother took him to Yathrib, an
                                oasis town a few hundred
                                miles north of Mecca, to stay with relatives and visit his father's grave there. On the
                                return journey, Amina took ill and died. She was buried in the village of Abwa on the
                                Mecca-Medina Road. Halima, his nurse, returned to Mecca with the orphaned boy and placed
                                him in the protection of his paternal grandfather, Abdul Al-Muttalib. In this man's
                                care, Muhammad learned the rudiments of statecraft. Mecca was Arabia's most important
                                pilgrimage center and Abdul Al-Muttalib its most respected leader. He controlled
                                important pilgrimage concessions and frequently presided over Mecca's Council of Elders.

                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>578 - </strong>Upon his grandfather's death in 578, Muhammad, aged about eight,
                                passed into the care of a paternal uncle, Abu Talib. Muhammad grew up in the older man's
                                home and remained under Abu Talib's protection for many years. Chroniclers have
                                underscored Muhammad's disrupted childhood. So does the Qur'an: "Did God not find you an
                                orphan and give you shelter and care? And He found you wandering, and gave you guidance.
                                And he found you in need, and made you independent" (93:6-8).</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>580-94 - </strong>When young boy, Muhammad worked as a shepherd to help pay his
                                keep (his uncle was of modest means). In his teens he sometimes traveled with Abu Talib,
                                who was a merchant, accompanying caravans to trade centers. On at least one occasion, he
                                is said to have traveled as far north as Syria. Older merchants recognized his character
                                and nicknamed him El–Amin, the one you can trust.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>594 - </strong>In his early twenties, Muhammad entered the service of a wealthy
                                Meccan merchant, a widow named Khadija bint Khawalayd. The two were distant cousins.
                                Muhammad carried her goods to the north and returned with a profit.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>595-609 - </strong>Impressed by Muhammad's honesty and character, Khadija
                                eventually proposed marriage. They were wed in about 595. He was twenty-five. She was
                                nearly forty.

                                Muhammad continued to manage Khadija's business affairs, and their next years were
                                pleasant and prosperous. Six children were born to them, two sons who both died in
                                infancy, and four daughters. Mecca prospered too, becoming a well–off trading center in
                                the hands of an elite group of clan leaders who were mostly successful traders.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>610 - </strong>Mecca's new materialism and its traditional idolatry disturbed
                                Muhammad. He began making long retreats to a mountain cave outside town. There, he
                                fasted and meditated. On one occasion, after a number of indistinct visionary
                                experiences, Muhammad was visited by an overpowering presence and instructed to recite
                                words of such beauty and force that he and others gradually attributed them to God. This
                                experience shook Muhammad to the core. It was several years before he dared to talk
                                about it outside his family.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>613 - </strong>After several similar experiences, Muhammad finally began to
                                reveal the messages he was receiving to his tribe. These were gathered verse by verse
                                and later would become the Qur'an, Islam's sacred scripture. In the next decade,
                                Muhammad and his followers were first belittled and ridiculed, then persecuted and
                                physically attacked for departing from traditional Mecca's tribal ways. Muhammad's
                                message was resolutely monotheistic. For several years, the the Quraysh, Mecca's
                                dominant tribe, levied a ban on trade with Muhammad's people, subjecting them to near
                                famine conditions. Toward the end of the decade, Muhammad's wife and uncle both died.
                                Finally, the leaders of Mecca attempted to assassinate Muhammad.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>622 - </strong>In 622, Muhammad and his few hundred followers left Mecca and
                                traveled to Yathrib, the oasis town where his father was buried. The leaders there were
                                suffering through a vicious civil war, and they had invited this man well known for his
                                wisdom to act as their mediator. Yathrib soon became known as Medina, the City of the
                                Prophet. Muhammad remained here for the next six years, building the first Muslim
                                community and gradually gathering more and more people to his side.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>625-28 - </strong>The Meccans did not take Muhammad's new success lightly. Early
                                skirmishes led to three major battles in the next three years. Of these the Muslims won
                                the first (the Battle of Badr, March, 624), lost the second (the Battle of Uhud, March,
                                625), and outlasted the third, (The Battle of the Trench and the Siege of Medina, April,
                                627). In March, 628, a treaty was signed between the two sides, which recognized the
                                Muslims as a new force in Arabia and gave them freedom to move unmolested throughout
                                Arabia. Meccan allies breached the treaty a year later.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>630 - </strong>By now, the balance of power had shifted radically away from
                                once-powerful Mecca, toward Muhammad and the Muslims. In January, 630, they marched on
                                Mecca and were joined by tribe after tribe along the way. They entered Mecca without
                                bloodshed and the Meccans, seeing the tide had turned, joined them.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>630-32 - </strong>Muhammad returned to live in Medina. In the next three years,
                                he consolidated most of the Arabian Peninsula under Islam. In March, 632, he returned to
                                Mecca one last time to perform a pilgrimage, and tens of thousands of Muslims joined
                                him.

                                After the pilgrimage, he returned to Medina. Three months later on June 8, 632 he died
                                there, after a brief illness. He is buried in the mosque in Medina. Within a hundred
                                years Muhammad's teaching and way of life had spread from the remote corners of Arabia
                                as far east as Indo-China and as far west as Morocco, France and Spain.</p>
